xpdAcq documentation
====================

Introduction

To post questions about anything XPD, including software, and to see archived answers, please join the `XPD-Users Google group

``xpdAcq`` is a Python package that aids data collection at the XPD beamlime. It is built on top of and augments the NSLS-II data acquisition Python
package `bluesky <http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/>`_ .

XPD may be operated directly by bluesky, or using xpdAcq.

The goal of the ``xpdAcq`` package is to simplify your collection and analysis workflow during beamtime,
so that you can focus more on scientific aspects of your experiment. Additionally, ``xpdAcq`` provides an interface
that needs less Python experience than the current native bluesky interface.

We hope that you find it intuitive, like the most important function to run a scan, ``xrun``:

.. code-block:: python

  xrun(sample-info, scan-info) #run this Sample with this Scan-Plan

To get started, please go to :ref:`quick_start`

If you have suggestions for new features in xpdAcq, or want to report a bug or simply ask a question about
the software, please post it as a new thread at `XPD-Users

What's new?
+++++++++++

current version : ``v0.6.0``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is a stable release of ``xpdAcq`` software.

This version is fully documented and extensively tested.

New features introduced to this version:

* Integration with automated data reduction pipeline. Now live visualization and
  automated data-saving is supported. For the details about the pipeline, please
  refer to `xpdAn documentation <http://xpdacq.github.io/xpdAn/>`_.


* Advanced shutter control logic for temperature-ramping scan plan,
  ``Tlist`` and ``Tramp``. By default, shutter will remain closed in
  between exposures, which prevent detector from burning. This behavior can
  be overridden, leaving the fast shutter open for the entire scan.
  Please refer to the function docstring by typing ``Tlist?`` or
  ``Tramp?`` in the ``collection`` terminal for more details.


* Refined metadata logic. We implement ``client-server`` logic which
  would largely enhance the linking between associated scans. For
  more details, please refer to :ref:`client_server_md`.


* Now programs takes in user defined folder tag so that it's easier to
  separate data into subfolders with memorable names. Please refer to
  :ref:`folder_tag`.


* Current version supports following built-in scans:

  .. code-block:: none

    single-frame (ct)
    time-series (tseries)
    temperature-series scans (Tramp)
    temperature-list scans (Tlist)


  Additional built-in scan types will be added in future releases.
